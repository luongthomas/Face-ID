## About this Project

This project demonstrates the capability of hiding specific views or parts of an app that can only be accessed after successfully authenticating with Face ID
in an iOS application.

## About the Series

As part of a series of learning and improving my understanding of the iOS and MacOS development ecosystem, I'm creating several XCode projects
that demonstrates specific features or concepts within a small application that is hopefully easy to understand.  

A side goal of doing this will provide a list of recipes that can be read from and incorporated into larger projects.


## Building the code
Open FaceID.xcodeproj in XCode and build the project, no third party dependencies were used so it should build without any additional steps.


## Getting involved

If you see any improvements that could be made or something that is done incorrectly, please feel free to create an issue or pull request.  
I'm open to hearing any kind of feedback or criticism that can help me improve as a developer.
